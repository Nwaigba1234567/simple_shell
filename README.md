# Simple Shell

This project is a simple UNIX-like shell implementation in C as part of our ALX Software Engineering course. It aims to demonstrate our understanding of various low-level programming concepts, such as system calls, file I/O, and memory management.

## Features

- Basic shell functionality
- Command execution
- Built-in commands

## Getting Started

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
